# Final-Year-Project-On-Dental-Problem-Classification

In recent years, in the field of dentistry, medical imaging technologies such as computed tomography (CT) or X-rays have aided the diagnosis of different diseases. There are two categories of Dental radiographs: intraoral where the film is positioned inside the buccal cavity, and extraoral where the patient is positioned between the source that emanates X-rays and the radiographic film. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are the preferred solutions for medical imaging analysis and have been employed in many clinical fields. By the use of U-Net Models and panoramic X-Ray images, we provide in this research a novel technique for the automated identification of teeth as well as the classification of dental diseases.
